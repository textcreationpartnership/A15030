            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>CHriſtian Reader, it is well knowne to all men, how odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly the adverſaries of the Churches reformation in England do accuſe and defame the ſeekers of the ſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation with Noueltie, Singularity, Schiſme, Error, and with many other ſuch like moſt foull crimes. The iniquity and vntruth whereof, will through Gods blesſing well appeare to euery one that ſhall read and pervſe this preſent moſt profitable <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. Wherein two maine and principall matters, to witt, The Inventions and Traditions of men in Church affayres, and the overreaching Clergy beyond the condition of ordinay Paſtors, (wherevnto all the particulars now in controuerſie are eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced) are obſerved in all ages and times ſince the Apoſtles to haue ben held by ſome godly perſons and faithfull Witneſſes of the truth to haue ben hainous transgresſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s againſt the ordinances of Chriſt in his New Teſtament. So that heerby men may ſee, that it is noe new thing, that the ſervants of Chriſt and the louers of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances ſhould ſtriue now againſt theſe Corruptions. For if this be Schismaticall now (I ſay, to ſtriue againſt theſe Corruptions) then ſurely all the holy Martyrs and pillars of the Goſpell in all ages paſt but chifly ſince the diſcovery of Antichriſt) were Schismatiks. For they then travayled &amp; laboured (as by this Discourſe we may ſee) in one and the ſame cauſe, wherin now the true ſeruants of Chriſt doe alſo labor. But if in former times thoſe were faithfull men, &amp; the true louers of the Gospell of Chriſt, who hated all mens <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> in matters of the Church, then doubtles ſoe are theſe now;
<pb facs="tcp:20397:3"/> and it will be manifeſt to all good men that they are wrongefully traduced and accuſed in ſuch wiſe as is before mentioned.</p>
            <p>To which end and purpoſe this ancient Chriſtian Gentlman hath worthily obſerved, gathered, and giuen out to the world (as his laſt ſervice to God &amp; to his people) theſe teſtimonies of ſundry old and new writers. The which comming vnto my hands, I could not in loue to thee (good Reader) but communicate the ſame vnto thee The rather conſidering how many thinges dayly are ſpoken &amp; written to the contrary by the adverſaryes, to dazell the eyes of Gods people in theſe cauſes. The Lord Ieſus inlighten the minds of all his true Children in all his wayes, who on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the way, the truth, and the life; and grant us his peace. Amen.</p>

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (notwithſtanding this excellent eſtate wherein they vvere, yet) heere it appeareth that many foule corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vvere even then crept in, both in the Paſtors &amp; Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and ſcarſly any one Church found to be free from foule abuſes: As you may plainly ſee in the diſcourſe of the ſeaven Churches of Aſia, if you read the 2 &amp; 3 chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Revelation. Wherevppon this objection may
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20397:6"/> and doth ariſe; Namely, that ſeeing ſuch abuſes and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions vvere in the moſt pure and ſinceare Primitiue Churches, why ſhould we not then at this day ſtaie our ſelues, though many foule diſorders, abuſes, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be found to be retained in our Churches. Whervnto may iuſtſly be anſweared, that contrary-wiſe the holy Ghoſt hath ſet downe the example of theſe moſt holy, pure, and Apoſtolicke Churches, vvith their faults and imperfections, and alſo their threatnings, that all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches following unto the end of the vvorld, ſhould be the more vigilant &amp; carefull that no corruption ſhould crepe in among them; ſeeing thoſe moſt pure, and vncorrupted times (in compariſon of the times following) vvere vvith ſo great difficultie preſerued from ſuch dangerous miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheifes, and never the leſſe vvere threatened of God with ſuch terrible plagues &amp; vengance for ſuffering the ſame. As, the removing the golden Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dleſticke from Epheſus, the fighting of Chriſt himſelfe vvith the Svvord of his mouth againſt the Church of Pergamus; The caſting of the <hi>Thyatirians</hi> into the bed of great afflictions, and that he vvould come vpon the Church of <hi>Sardis</hi> as a theife in the night, and that they ſhould not knowe vvhat hower he vvould come vpon them. And to conclude, that he vvould ſpue the luke warme <hi>Laodicians</hi> out of his mouth. All vvhich greuous plagues in a ſhort time fell vpon thos Churches of Aſia. And ſhall vvee eſcape, if now in this great light of the Goſpell, vve retaine and maintayne any filthines of corruption in our Churches? No, God is not partiall; neither vvith him is any variablenes, neither ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing by turnning. Beſides heer alſo it is vvorthly to be noted, that among theſe ſeaven Churches of Aſia repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting all other thereis not one word ſpoken of an Arch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>angel,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20397:6"/> Archbiſhop, or Lord Biſhop that might over rule or governe <hi>all the reſt,</hi> vvhich in theſe our times are ſome of the greateſt and moſt noiſome corruptions vvhich doe overflowe all. To vvhich purpoſe I heere ſet downe the vvords of <hi>M. Fox,</hi> ſpeaking of the firſt &amp; Primitiue Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; his vvords are theſe.<note place="margin">Act Mon. p, 36;</note> 
               <hi>It is evident</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to all men that haue eyes in their head, &amp;c. that there was not then any one Mother Church aboue other Churches,</hi>

            <p>There remaineth now, to ſpeake of the third generall thing vvhich Chriſt heere commaundeth his ſervant <hi>Iohn</hi> to vvrite of, namely, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>

And how the Synagogue of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and the vvhore of Babilon by litle and litle ſhould creepe in, and vvith her filthines endeavour to envenime the Churches; till at the laſt ſhe ſhould become that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious vvhore deſcribed in the 17. chapter, clothed in ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let and purple, guilded vvith gold, pretious ſtones, and pearles, and having a cup of gold in her hand, full of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations &amp; filthines of her fornication, ſitting upon the ſcarlet coullered Beaſt, having ſeave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heads &amp; ten hornes; and by her glorious power ſhould baniſh the true Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God, and make make them flie into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that is into ſecret places, hidden, and vnknowne vnto men.

            <p>Now this beginnyng of corruption both in doctrine and Diſcipline made no long delaye, after the Apoſtles time.<note place="margin">Euſebius Hiſt Eccle,</note> For as <hi>Evſebius</hi> in his Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory. <hi>lib 3. cap 32.</hi> ſaith. Vt vero et Apoſtolorum chorus. &amp;c. <hi>As ſoone as the company of the Apoſtles and all that age which had received the hearing of the Lords owne liuely voyce, was departed out of this world: then as it were into an emptie houſe, the wicked error of falſe doctrine thruſt in and plunged her ſelfe.</hi> Which thing alſo is euident, by all Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtories: as the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of <hi>Cerinthus</hi> ſheweth about the yeare of our Lord 70. Which taught that the vvorld vvas not made of God, but of Angells, and that Circumciſion vvas neceſſary to be obſerved, and that the kingdome of Chriſt after the reſur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rection ſhould be vpon the earth. And likewiſe the hereſy of the <hi>Ebionites</hi> about the yeare 85. Which taught that Chriſt vvas very man both by Father and Mother, and that Moſes law vvas neceſſary to be obſerved. Thus daily many hereſies and foule corruptions crept in, ſo that by the time that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> lived, they vvrote ſpeciall books againſt hereſies (to the number of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſeverall hereſies of note) co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tayning all of them great corruptions, ſome in doctrine and manners, ſome in Diſcipline and orders of the Church. Which corruption in Church-Diſcipline was often times the cauſe of the hereticall doctrine. And heerin I purpoſe (God asſiſting me) cheifly at this time to inſiſt: ſhewing what the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers of the Primitiue Church did practiſe &amp; teach
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20397:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> in theſe pointes of religion now controverſied among vs: and likwiſe what the lightes of the goſpell &amp; the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Martyrs of God from age to age ſince, even vnto this day haue alſo practiſed and taught touching the ſame.</p>
            <p>And this I doe the rather; becauſe many excellent men haue alreadie by manifold reaſons grounded and taken out of the word of God, proved that there ought to be a full reformation both in Doctrine and Diſcipline, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that order in the Church which Chriſt and his Apoſtles left; Which muſt be acknowledged to be the onely ſure ground of proofe for all pointes of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in the Church of God. But becauſe the enimyes of ful &amp; true <hi>Reformation</hi> of religion, doe yet (after the old faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) reſt vpon cuſtome, antiquitie, and auncient Fathers: I haue thought good to follow this courſe before named, that it might be plainely ſeene, both how the cheife of the auncient Fathers, and alſo of the principall lights, ſet vp by the Lord in the deapth of the darknes of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; with one voyce &amp; agrement taught, practiſed, and proved the ſame, both by the ſcriptures, and manifold reaſons grounded thereon, touching the matters of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation now deſired.</p>
            <p>And heerin I thinke good for example (before I enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the reſt) to ſet downe out of <hi>Epiphanius</hi> the hereſie of <hi>Audianus,</hi> which heretickes were afterward called <hi>Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomorphits,</hi> who being thruſt out of the Church as ſimple men (in time lacking learned teachers) fell into a perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and beleife, that God was like vnto a man, whereof they tooke the name of their hereſie. <hi>Erat autem vir a Meſopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia oriundus clarus in patria ſua &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epiphanius de Hereſ.</note> 
               <hi>Audianus</hi> (ſaith Epipha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nius) <hi>was a man by birth of Meſopotamia, a famous man in his owne Countrie, for the ſinceritie of his life and of faith and Zeale
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20397:8"/> towards God, which often beholding the things that were done in the Churches, he did oppoſe himſelfe againſt ſuch evills, even to the face of the</hi> Biſhops <hi>and</hi> Elders, <hi>and did reproue them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Theſe things ought not to be ſoe done, theſe thinges ought not to be ſoe handled, as a man ſtudious of the veritie, and of ſuch thinges as are ſpoken by men, which lead a moſt exacte life; and are vſually ſpoken for loue of the truth. Wherefore</hi> Audianus <hi>ſeeing ſuch thinges</hi> (as I haue ſaid) <hi>in the Churches, he was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſpeake and confute it and kept not ſilence. For if he ſaw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Cleargie to ſeeke after filthy luker, whether he were</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>or</hi> Elder, <hi>or any other: he ſpake altogeather according to the rule of Gods law.

And this was very grevous to them that were of a lewd life: and for this cauſe he was deſpited with contumelies and ſuffered contradiction, he was hated, and ſuffered himſelfe to be vexed and thruſt out, and tollerated ſhamefull ignominie, continuing ſoe a long time in the Church among them, vntill ſuch time as certaine men violently ruſhing upon him, droue him out for the ſame cauſe. But hee would not ſuffer himſelfe ſo to be driven out, but rather endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored himſelfe to ſpeake the truth, and not to depart, and breake the bonde of the vnion of the Catholicke Church.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Audianus was no Heretike, nor his preſent company. But their Succeſſors were Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morphits.</note>

            <p>But to returne neerer to the firſt originall corruptions that began immediatly after the Apſtles time: you ſhall find in all the moſt auncient Fathers a great libertie taken

What injurie this was to all other Paſtors &amp; El<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ders, yea &amp; to the holy Ghoſt himſelfe, which gaue them all, as well as to any one that reverent name of Biſhop; he that hath eyes in his head may eaſily ſee. For as poore chriſtians ſhould haue great injurie if it ſhould be made vnlawfull to call any man a Chriſtian, or a chriſtian man, but only a Prince, a Lord, or a Noble man: ſo all the pore Paſtors and Miniſters haue great injurie, that one Lord in a Citie or Dioces, onely, ſhould be called Biſhop, ſeeing Gods owne word calleth all Paſtors and Miniſters of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20397:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> word Biſhops; as well as all faithfull people Chriſtians. And thus within a while theſe Biſhops did not only take to themſelues the name, wealth, &amp; dignities which God forbiddeth them; but they tooke from other ſuch names, wealth, and dignities as God had appointed them.

            <p>The Papiſts themſelues ſeeking for the Etymologie
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20397:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> of this word, are ſoe aſtoniſhed therein, that ſome of them ſay it was taken from <hi>Papé,</hi> the interjection of wonder. Howſoever, a word it is fecht out of the bottomles pit of hell, that it might be a marke to make difference between a Miniſter and a Biſhop, and betweene a Paſtor and a-Pope, as the word <hi>Miſſa</hi> was deviſed by the Devill to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe the Communion withall, and to ſuperſubſtantiat the bleſſed bread of the Lords Supper into the curſed Idoll of the Popes maſſe.

Neither doe I ſpeake theſe things to condemne thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent auncient Fathers, (who otherwiſe many yeares were ſingular inſtruments &amp; profited greatly the Church of God) but to ſhew how great a buſes crept in, duringe the moſt pure times, (like as hath been before ſaid) even in the time of the Apoſtles themſelues, and after more &amp; more vnto the full ſetting up of Antichriſt the Pope, that great <hi>Papa,</hi> (the Biſhop of Rome) who alone gat this na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e <hi>Papa</hi> Pope, at the laſt to be peculiar &amp; proper to himſelfe. Thus growing vp by little and litle, from the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng of the petie <hi>Papa,</hi> vntill he and all his cleargie with him, came vp vnto their full perfection, and papiſticall dig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nitie. Which time when it drew neere, errours and moſt enormous and ſhamefull abuſes crept not in by litle and litle, but were throwne in by ſhouelles full, and cart loads. And further I noted it, to ſet forth the wonderfull provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God (without which nothing is done in heave<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> earth, or hell.) To ſet ſuch manifeſt charecters and markes vpon the firſt beginnings of miſcheife, which although it could hardlie be diſcerned in the beginnings thereof, yet
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:20397:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> in the event and full high eſtate wherevnto they grew, a very child might vnderſtand, perceaue and ſee it. So that at the lenght when the new light of the goſpell ſhould ſhine, even the old and firſt originall errors might therby the better be corrected. For in Prophecies &amp; myſteries it muſt alwayes be obſerued, which that moſt auncient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ireneus</hi> ſaith in his 4. booke &amp; 43. chapter. <hi>Omnis enim prophetia priuſquam habet efficacia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c.</hi> All prophecies (ſaith he) before they haue the effect, be as it were riddles &amp; am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguities vnto men: but when the time is come, and that is come to paſſe which is propheſied, then the propheſies haue a cleare and vndoubted expoſition. So we ſee in this myſterie of <hi>Papa</hi> or Pope when it firſt began, it was ſuch an <hi>aenigma,</hi> as was almoſt vnposſible to vnderſtand wherevnto the old Serpent ment to bring it. But now the event thereof being come, and the Angell betweene heaven and earth preaching the everlaſtinge Goſpell and ſetting up the new light thereof in many Nations and Churches: every man that wincketh not may ſee it.</p>
            <p>Now therefore to proceede, (<hi>as</hi> Auguſtine <hi>ſaith in his 18. booke and Second chapter,</hi> of the Cittie of God: <hi>That it may the better appeare how Babilon the firſt Rome kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth her courſe with the Citie of God, whom ſhee maketh a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grime or ſtranger in this world.</hi>) When the name of <hi>Pope</hi> had thus poſſeſſed the Biſhops whereof many were both godly and learned, yet they never drempt of the miſcheif that followed, nor of the great <hi>Papa</hi> the Pope that man of ſinne even the ſonne of perdition, that exalteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe againſt all that is called God, and ſitteth in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God ſheewing himſelfe that he is God.

Alſo</hi> Chriſoſtome <hi>ſaith, I ſay bouldy that the Bishops and Prelats of the Church, may haue nothinge but meate and drinke and clothinge, leaſt they ſhould ſet their affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon thoſe thinges.

            <p>Now the Apoſtle in the ſame chapter proueth, that the Preachers of the Goſpell ought to haue not onely a bare living, but alſo maintenance, when he ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.3 4 5 6,</note> 
               <hi>My de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to them that examine me is this. Haue we not power to eate
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20397:17"/> and drinke. Or haue we not power to leade about a wife being a ſiſter as well as the reſt of the Apoſtles, and as the brethren of the</hi> Lord <hi>&amp;</hi> Cephas? <hi>Or I onely and</hi> Barnabas, <hi>haue not we power not to worke.</hi> By theſe words it is moſt manifeſtly and cleer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly proved, that the Preachers of the Goſpell with their wiues and houſhoulds ſhould haue ſuch a ſufficiency of lyving, as might maintaine them in good ſorte with out any labour of their owne handes. So that all preachers of the word of God haue authoritie &amp; power not to worke, but ſo to be maintayned, that they may wholy and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather attend upon their Eccleſiaſticall functions.</p>
            <p>Further alſo, that the Preachers of Gods word ought to be ſo maintained as they ſhould not neede to worke &amp; labour with their hands, is moſt evidently proved in the ſixt of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where all the twelue Apoſtles with one conſent ſay,<note place="margin">Acts 6.2.</note> 
               <hi>It is not meete that we ſhould leaue the word of God to ſerue the tables.</hi> For if it were meete, that the preachers of the word of God ſhould be imployed or occupied in any worke or buſines in the world; What imployment would be fitter, then that holy labour of attendance vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the poore? And marke theſe words of the holy Ghoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nounced with a full conſent of all the Apoſtles; <hi>That we ſhould leaue the word of God,</hi> (ſay they) whereby they plaine<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly declare that they muſt needes haue left the preaching of the word of God, if they ſhould haue attended upon any other bvſines whatſoever. Now if the Apoſtles covld not doe it, what Biſhops or Paſtors are able to performe it? Can Satan ſo blinde their eyes, that they ſhould think themſelues wiſer; and endued with greater graces and guifts of God then all the Apoſtles of Chriſt, ſo that they can performe more dueties, offices, and functions, then the Apoſtles were able to doe? And marke the concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

And herevnto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeeth the example of the Prophets, who being extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily called, had far leſſe neede of any ordinary asſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:20397:18"/> of ſervice. God himſelfe immediatly commanding other to ſuſtaine them, and the very foules of the aire to feede them. Who havinge power to commaund fire to fall from heaven, upon their wicked adverſaries, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to raiſe the dead to life againe for their beloved fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, God ſo providing for them that one handfull of meale &amp; a litle oyle in a cruſe ſhould grow and increaſe to ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance that it ſuſtained them and other a long time. And not onely in matter of bodily ſuſtenance, but alſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the payment of their debtes to their poore frends, ſo to multiplie the creatures of God for them that they had abundance, both to pay their creditors, and to ſuſtai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e themſelues.</p>
            <p>Theſe Prophets therefore a man would thinke, ſhould haue litle neede of ordinary attendance of a ſervant to waite upon them, yet God would haue it that each of them, ſhould haue ſuch ordinarie maintenance, that they ſhould be able to keepe one man to attend upon them. That they might be freer from the buſines and affaires of this life, and to attend whollie and continually to prayer and adminiſtration of the word. As <hi>Eliiah</hi> had by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyntment of God <hi>Eliſha</hi> to waite upon him and to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer water upon his handes.

And not unfitly heerevnto may be joyned the

I neede not to amplifie this matter: ye ſee (as I haue ſaide) the eſtate of the Miniſters of Gods word both in the old Teſtament and in the New, vnder thoſe Kings and Princes which ſo highly favoured, hono<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red, and ſo dearely loved them.

            <p>Heere you ſee the eſtate that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Biſhop in the world at that time was in, and how the Biſhops themſelues, and the moſt godly Princes, and Emperours thought fit for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to liue in. All theſe things being conſidered, I conclude that the Paſtor or Preacher of the word of God, ought to be ſo maintayned that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freed from all other buſines, he might haue one man at all times to waite upon him. Whereunto a convenient proportion of living, as the ſtate and rate of thinges ſtand at this day in England cannot be leſſe then one hundred pounds by the yeare, conſidering that he may not attend upon any other occupying, affayres, or buſines, but onely and continually upon prayer and adminiſtration of the word. Wherefore I ſay, at the leaſt one hundred by the yeare: for ſo the ſound judgment of reaſon requyreth.

            <p>If <hi>Appelles</hi> with his penſill ſhould haue paynted out this matter, he could never halfe ſo liuely haue paynted out the Lord Biſhop and the Pariſh preiſt of our dayes; as this <hi>goulden mouth</hi> in theſe wordes hath done, condemnyng both theſe extreames as ſhamefull and abominable. But I leaue it to the reader that winketh not, but openeth his
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20397:28"/> eyes to behold the ſtate of the Church in our time and to compare it with that time. In his 50 <hi>Hom.</hi> vpon the Epiſtle to Timothie the 5 chap:<note place="margin">Chryſ. in 1. Tim.</note> he diſcourſeth in theſe words. <hi>Honorem hoc in loco obſequium &amp;c. In this place</hi> (ſaith Chryſoſtome) <hi>honor is taken for readines to doe the thing that a man is willed to doe, and for needfull liberalitie. For that which followeth, thou ſhalt not mouſell the mouth of the Oxe that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out the corne, and the laborer is worthy of his reward, ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that to be the Apoſtles meanyng; for when he alſo comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that widowes ſhould be cheriſhed with honor, it muſt needes be referred to a neceſſary livyng &amp;c. Therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if any man be a delicat fellow or negligent in his office, he is ſurely wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of no reward except he be an Oxe that treadeth out the corne: except he draw the yoke even againſt the thornes and the froſt &amp; ſhrinke not away, he is unworthy. Therefore unto the Teachers a neceſſary livyng ought plentifully to be miniſtred, leaſt they ſhould faint or be diſcomforted; neither that being occupied in the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt thinges they ſhould depriue themſelues and other of great things; that they might worke ſpirituall things, having no regard of ſecular affaires: For ſuch were the Levits, which had no charg of worldly buſines as the lay men had. Yet to the Levits ſome care of ſuch thinges was permitted, and by the law there was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted unto them revenues, tithes, firſt fruits, vowes, and many other things; but unto them by the law theſe thinges were worthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie permitted; as unto them that ſought things preſent &amp; earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> Now Chryſoſtome concludeth with theſe words. <hi>Yet I</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will ſpeake it bouldly, that the cheifeſt Prelats of the Church ought to haue no more but onely foode and rayment, leaſt their affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s ſhould be drawne away to thes worldly things.</hi> He ſaith not; that they ſhould haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet not ſet their affec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but he ſaith they ſhould not haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> leaſt their affections ſhould thereby be drawne to loue them.

To conclude, then the holy regiment of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Chriſt ſtanding in the ſimplicity and playnens of Paſtors, Elders. &amp; Deacons, began utterly to be defaced; &amp; the little ſparke <hi>Papa</hi> brake forth which at the firſt ſtuck but as a ſmall ſpot upon the forhead of the Biſhop: no man thinking it to be any bleamiſh, not knowing from whence it came nor whervnto the old ſerpent called the Deuill and Satan meant to bring it. Now this monſtrous regiment takinge place and the regiment appointed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles reſtyng cheifly in ſpirituall excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, the glory wherof could not be ſeene with outward fleſhly eyes, beyng counted for the ſimplicity &amp; plaines thereof to baſe a regiment for the glorious ſtrumpet: ſhe tooke into her handes her paire of bellowes of pride and ambition, and never left blowyng with all her might and maine upon the litle ſparke <hi>Papa</hi> aforeſaid, till it grew to a flame that reached up to heaven; in which infernall flame the great <hi>Papa</hi> himſelfe ſheweth forth his face. Takyng that name to himſelfe only, as being from the beginnyng thereof appoynted unto him by the old ſerpent Sathan his father: And as beyng now of full age he himſelfe alo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e would weare it, though in his minority other were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to uſe it.</p>
            <p>Now this great Antichriſt <hi>Papa</hi> the Pope raigneth &amp; floriſheth, exaltyng himſelfe againſt all that is called God or that is worſhiped, ſo as he doth ſit as God in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God,<note place="margin">The higheſt Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption &amp; tyran<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny.</note> ſhewyng himſelfe that he is God. And for the maintenance of his high exaltation he thought it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyſite aboue all other to take care of theſe two thinges: Firſt, how to keepe under the temporall Princes &amp; Lords
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:20397:31"/> which had long raigned before him: and to ſet up his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Lords as his owne creatures, which ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteyning and beholding to himſelfe onely for all their Lordly eſtate:<note place="margin">The higheſt eccleſiaſtical corruption and tyranny</note> that at the laſt both the Lords temporall &amp; ſpirituall might ſerue him to his great glory. Now this great Antichriſt reignyng over his temporall Lords and Princes, who by the ordinance of God were appoynted to reigne themſelues to the honor of Chriſt, and not to the glory of Antichriſt; and ſpecially triumphing by his ſpirituall Lords as his owne creatures created unto their Lordſhips and Archlordſhips by himſelfe onely, and not ordeyned therevnto by God; but by him appoynted for his ſpeciall gard and defence of his owne perſon, and of his wife the great whore of <hi>Babell:</hi> It pleaſed the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, which created heaven and earth in the time by him appoynted,<note place="margin">reformation beginyng.</note> to rayſe vp againe agreeable unto his firſt inſtitution certayne poore Miniſters, Biſhops &amp; Paſtors, to whom he committed the word of God, which is the ſword of the ſpirit, therwith to fight againſt this glorious <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and all his ſpirituall Lords.</p>
            <p>And therefore as you haue heard before, the auntient Fathers utterly condemning the great livyngs and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſtate of Biſhops, both by their doctrine, decrees, and practiſe of their owne lyues; Now likewiſe let us heare what theſe men thus newly rayſed up of God, hold and affirme, &amp; alſo in the practiſe of their owne liues approue touching the ſame Lordſhip of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and other unwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Traditions</hi> of men.</p>

Heere Lordſhip and Dominion is plainly forbidden to the Apoſtles: and dareſt thou then vſurpe the ſame? If thou wilt be a Lord thou shalt looſe thine Apoſtleship, or if thou wilt be an Apoſtle thou shalt loſe thy Lordship. For truely thou shalt departe from the one of them.

            <p>Surely this was but apoore Lord Biſhop that went in ſuch a graye coate, as <hi>M.

               <hi>they ordeyned ſome one or other of them, ſuch as lived honeſtly and unblameablie, and had wife and children and alſo skilfull in the Scriptures of God, to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:20397:36"/> to haue the ſuperintendencie and charge over the reſt. And them they called</hi> Seniors <hi>or</hi> Elders, <hi>whom afterward both</hi> Saint Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>and alſo</hi> S.

Within a while they ſaw many people come flocking to him, to whom he preached and expounded the word of God, wherby they perceaved that he was their Paſtor or Biſhop. For in thoſe dayes there was no difference either in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell or manners betweene the Biſhops and the reſidue of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which ſaying of <hi>M: Luther</hi> theſe three things are to be obſerved. Firſt that there was no differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the word of God, (and by the doctrine of the Apoſtles) between a Biſhop and an Elder or Miniſter: or as he is now called a Pariſh Prieſt, in the latin word (taken out of the Greeke) <hi>Presbyter;</hi> for in the new Teſtament, (as you haue heard before) he is never called <hi>Sacerdos</hi> that is to ſay a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> as in all the old Teſtament it is ever engliſhed. But heer you ſee plainly by the judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>M. Luther,</hi> that a Biſhop by the word of God and doctrine of the Apoſtles is nothing elſe but the Miniſter of a Pariſh. And you heard before how preciſly and violently he rejected whatſoever ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in the Church hath not the expreſſe word of God and commandement for it. And therefore (he ſaith) tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching all conſtitutions of Biſhops, without this expreſſe warrant we ought to take them for lyers &amp; deceavers, and by no meanes to ſubſcrib unto them. Seeing this he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not onely of Ceremonies and other traditions: but even of the goverment &amp; orders of the Church, as in the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20397:36"/> ſame place within a few words he plainly and vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſeth. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is nothing ſo pernicious, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo monſtrous,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet: 4.11</note> 
               <hi>nothing ſo beaſtly as to goe about to governe the Church of God without the warrant of Gods owne word and worke. And therefore</hi> S. Peter <hi>ſaw great reaſon to ad this much, thereby to teach, how the Church ought to be governed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in the fift chapter he doth in a mannner repeate the ſame againe, for taking occaſion from the care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence that every Biſhop and Paſtor, ought to haue of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular within his owne flocke.<note place="margin">In chap <hi>5</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Heereby</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we may well perceiue and know, that a Biſhop is even the ſame that is here ment by an Elder. And therefore it is not true, which ſome ſay, that a Biſhoprick is a dignitie, and a Biſhop onely he that weareth a forked</hi> Miter. Epiſcopacie <hi>is not a name of dignitie, but of Office.</hi> Which thing he alſo affirmeth in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as in his booke <hi>contra Papatum</hi> he ſaith. <hi>Biſhops whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be in all the world, are equall to our</hi> Biſhops <hi>or</hi> Pariſh Miniſters <hi>and</hi> Preachers: <hi>Of none can it be ſaid, one is Lord, and other a Servant.</hi> Where <hi>Luther</hi> uſeth this word <hi>vel paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chis</hi> which muſt needes be engliſhed, either after the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh phraſe, Pariſh prieſts, or in better Engliſh pariſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. Which you ſee heere <hi>M. Luther</hi> maketh as great a Lordbiſhop as a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhop or Biſhop of a Dioceſe, and unto this rule he pulleth downe the proud <hi>Pope</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and ſo breaketh the necke of his Popedome. For he ſaith that Biſhops in all the world are not other in right and truth, but Pariſh Miniſters: and that the one ought not to liue like a Lord and the other like a Miniſter or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. And upon the 5 chapter of <hi>Peter</hi> aforeſaid (he ſaith) <hi>Furthermore.</hi> S. Peter <hi>calleth it peculiarly the flocke of Chriſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In chap: <hi>5:</hi>2.</note> 
               <hi>as though he ſhould ſay: Thinke not, that the flocke is any of your owne, ye are but onely Servants and Miniſters to looke unto it, ye
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:20397:37"/> ye are no Lords nor Maſters over it.</hi> And further afterward he ſaith: <hi>For we haue but one Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and he it is which governeth over ſoules. Elders &amp; Paſtors haue no further charge then to feed. And heere in one word</hi> S Peter <hi>overthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth all the kingdome of the Pope: and concludeth that no Biſhop hath any authority, ſo much as in one word to clogg and tye the conſciences of the faithfull to the obſervation of their precepts. For they themſelues ought to be ſervants and Miniſters, and to ſay; thus ſaith the Lord, and theſe be the words of Chriſt; it is not we, the words are none of ours: and therefore ye ought to doe that which is here commanded. According to that which Chriſt ſaith</hi> Luke the 22. <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles reigne over them, and they that beare rule overthem are called gratious Lords, but ye shall not be ſo. Contrary whereunto the</hi> Pope <hi>boaſteth and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth, ſaying: we ought to be Lords, and to us onely it belongeth to excerciſe cheife rule and ſupreme authoritie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing that I ſpeake of to be obſerved in the former ſaying of <hi>M. Luther</hi> is this. That the ſtate of Biſhops in thoſe dayes was ſuch, that a Biſhop could not be knowen by any Lordly countenance, or attendance, from a plaine man of the countrie.</p>
            <p>The third thing is, that in his apparell he differed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the common ſort of men, he had not on his head (as our booke of Martyrs (of a certaine Biſhop ſaith) a <hi>Geometricall,</hi> (that is to ſay, a ſquare) <hi>cap, although his head be round:</hi> nor a white <hi>rochet</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his blake coat: nor a prieſts cloke, nor a formall gowne. For by thoſe Mathematicall marks he muſt needs then haue been knowen fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a plaine man of the Country, as that foreſaid Biſhop in <hi>Africa</hi> was not. Yea though he had been an unpreaching Prelat, and ſo could not haue been knowen by his preaching.</p>
            <p>But let us heare what <hi>M. Luther</hi> further ſaith. In our
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:20397:37"/> booke of Martyrs many thinges are ſpecified which are moſt worthy to be noted concernyng him:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Fox</hi> Edition 1570 to. 2. pag 976. Election of Miniſters ought to be by the Church to whom they belong.</note> but for brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſake I will onely obſerue this one thing, namely, that he affirmeth <hi>the voyces of the people, ought not to be ſevered from the chooſing of Eccleſiaſticall perſons,</hi> in which poynt all the auncient Fathers doe with one voyce agree with <hi>M. Luther:</hi> they were alſo choſen themſelues in that manner, and ſo cauſed other to be choſen. And ſo likewiſe all the Proteſtant writers, and lights of the goſpell do generallie affirme in their writings that by the law of God, and by the holy Scriptures it ought to be ſtill obſerved in the Churches of God. And yet at this day it is exploded out of many Churches (as namely here with us) that profeſſe the Goſpell, as a thing that cannot ſtand with a Chriſtian common wealth: wherein I will onely recite the wordes of our booke of Martyrs, and one worthy ſentence, and alſo one notable example out of auncient Fathers, and ſo leaue it to the conſideration of the Chriſtian reader, and to the conſciences of all chriſtian Magiſtrats that profeſſ the Goſpell: with myne owne prayers to God, that this Apoſtolicke order of choſing of Miniſters, may be againe reſtored to all Chriſtian Churches.<note place="margin">

Cui ergo ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae offendens pcccator indicari debet? Ad eccleſiam univerſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſtus nimirum nos ire non mandat, nam haec nuſqua hic coit corporaliter.</hi> They hold that the excommunication by the Biſhop is the Churches excommunication. But <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> thoſe thinges are to be obſerved (which before we haue ſpoken in the 8 article) that the Church in the ſcriptures is eyther taken for all chriſtians which upon the earth do never viſibly meet together, which are only knowne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and in this Church are all they which beleeue in God the Father and cleaue faſt vnto him through Chriſt, and this is the Church which we acknowledg in the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of our faith, or elſe it is taken for every perticular Church which they call pariſhes. Therefore the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle and the cloked conſpiration of theſe diſguiſed Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops cannot be comprehended under the name of the Church,<note place="margin">Synods:</note> neither can they proue it by the ſcriptures that they be the Church though they would burſt. therefore it is cleare that they be not the Church unto which the offending ſinner ought to be ſhewed: for it is manifeſt that Chriſt doth not command us to go tell the univerſal Church: for this Church never meets together bodily. And agayne he ſaith. <hi>Quis enim omnes pios congregare poſſet: reſtat ergo ut eccleſiae iubeat Chriſtus indicandum peccatorem quam paraeciam vocamus.</hi> For who can gather together all the faithfull, therefore it can be taken non otherwiſe but that Chriſt commandeth the offender to be iudged by the Church which we call a pariſh.</p>
            <p>Now let us goe forward to heare what the reſt of the excellent lights and Angells or Meſſengers which God hath rayſed in this our age &amp; ſet up upon the golden can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:20397:41"/> (among which Chriſt himſelfe walketh) in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, Helvetia, Savoy, France &amp;c.</hi> concernyng the pulling downe of the whore of Babell, and the reformation in the poynts of religion a foreſayd. Wherin if there be any that thinke ſome ſpeaches before, or hereafter to be utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red be over bitter, let them marke what <hi>M: Luther</hi> ſayth upon the Epiſtle of <hi>Peter</hi> a foreſayd. <hi>Now their be many</hi> (ſayth he) <hi>that can well inough abide to haue the Goſpell prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, ſo that their might be no exclayming and ſpeakyng againſt the Wolues. I meane, ſo that the Preachers in their Sermons would forbeare exclayming and taunting againſt Prelats. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I Preach ſound doctrine, and that which is true: and though I feed and teach (my charg) the ſheepe well and rightly, yet is not that ſufficient: for it is further requyred at my hands to keep the ſheep from danger, and to haue a carefull regard unto them, that Wolues come not among them to driue them away out of their fertile and wholeſome paſtures. For to what purpoſe is my building, if when I haue couched and orderly layd my ſtones, an other ſtraight wayes come and hurle them downe as faſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne, and I ſeeyng him forbid him not? The Wolfe is well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough contented that the ſheepe be well fed and fatted in good Paſture, becauſe the fatter they be, the pleaſanter and daintier pray he thinketh to make of them. But that Doggs ſhould inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly barke and baule at him, that he cannot abide. Such barking doggs they cannot abide, but dumb doggs, they can beare well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough with all.</hi>

            <p>The next light ſet vp among the golden Candleſticks of Germanie to ſhew forth the darknes of Antichriſt: and the blindnes of the Romiſh Babilon, was <hi>M. Bucer,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Bucer.</hi> pag 2148: edit, 1570. col.</note> who for his learned excellency was ſent for by <hi>K. Edward</hi> the Sixt and appoynted to be the Divinitie Reader in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg,</hi> of whom <hi>M: Fox</hi> in our booke of Martyrs ſaith. <hi>He
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:20397:42"/> brought all men into ſuch admiration of him, that neither his frends could ſufficiently prayſe him, neither his enimyes in any poynt find fault with his ſinguler life &amp; ſincere doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How earneſtly <hi>M: Bucer</hi> deſired to haue a better reformation of religion in <hi>England</hi> then was in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, appeareth evidently in his booke <hi>De Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Chriſti,</hi> written to King <hi>Edward</hi> that moſt gratious and religious King of England, whom both <hi>Ridly</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Cranmer</hi> Archbiſhop of Caunterburie con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feſſed to haue more divinitie in his litle finger then they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues in their whole bodyes, as you may read in our booke of Martyrs: ſuch an excellent impresſion of true Divinity had God ingraven in his breſt beyng then but a child. Who no doubt if he had lived, as he had in many things well begun, ſo would he haue made a full reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe foule corruptions that remayned and yet re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maine to this day, and would haue reduced all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in his Dominions, unto the Primitiue and Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like order and Diſcipline, which <hi>M. Bucer</hi> in his ſayd book <hi>of the Kingdome of Chriſt</hi> written unto him for the ſame purpoſe, ſo earneſtly deſireth. Whoſe words in his firſt booke and 15. chapter are theſe. <hi>Vt vero claris Dominus et gravisſimis verbis diſciplinam ſuam cum vitae vniverſae,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De regni Chriſti 1, 15</note> 
               <hi>tum agendae penitentiae, tumetiam ſacrarum ceremoniarum ſanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, etc.</hi> With what playne and cleare words (ſaith <hi>M. Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>) hath the Lord eſtabliſhed his Diſcipline, as well of the whole courſe of life, as of ſhewing publike repentance, &amp; alſo of the holy Ceremonies? Yet how few ſhall you find even among thoſe which are cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted men of ſpeciall note among Chriſtians, which I will not ſay deſire with all their heart to haue this Diſcipline reſtored, which is the only Diſcipline of health or ſalvation, but that thinke it a
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:20397:42"/> thing worthy once to go about it. They ſay, the times are now farr otherwiſe, then it was when this Diſcipline flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the firſt Churches: men are now of an other ſorte: And it is to be feared leaſt by the reſtoring of this Diſcipline the Churches ſhould be more troubled, then edified; and that more men ſhould therby be frayed from the Goſpell, then ſhould be brought unto it. To conclud that it is to be feared that by this meanes it ſhould grow into a new tyranny of a falſe Cleargie upon the people of Chriſt. But do not theſe men even by their owne wordes manifeſtly convince themſelues of their horrible igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance concernyng the profit of the kingdome of Chriſt and the true benefitts therof? For know not they that the kingdome of Chriſt is a kingdome of all ages, and of all men which are elect to ſalvation? They are ignorant that King Ieſus, that is to ſay, the Saviour of men, and the beſt Paſtor or ſheepheard of his owne ſheepe, hath inſtituted nothing at all and commanded nothing to thoſe that are his, which is not healthfull unto them in all times and pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ces, if it be uſed as he inſtituted &amp; commanded the ſame.<note place="margin">Bucer in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians 4.</note> And upon the 4 chapter to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> he ſayth. Sathan goeth about to make men beleiue, that by the reſtoring of the diſciplin, the faithfull Miniſters ſhould be thought to ſeeke ambitiouſly, the ſame tyrannie which Antichriſt did.</p>
            <p>Yee ſee with what force of wordes <hi>M. Bucer</hi> lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the lacke of true Diſcipline in England, even in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time, and how vehemently he deſired the King to reſtore and eſtabliſh the ſame; which in his time could never be performed by reaſon of his ſuddaine death in the minoritie of his yeares. And afterward in the dayes of Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the Goſpell was receaved aboue 40.
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:20397:43"/> yeares and no fault by publik authority amended (which King <hi>Edward</hi> left) in the Diſcipline of the Church. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by the way, I cannot but note one pretie litle poynt of the Dragon that ſubtle ſerpent Sathanas, for the better ſafegard of his ſonne Antichriſt his creedit, and his deare daughter Babilon the great whore of <hi>Rome:</hi> for ſlily and cunningly he ſo ſcraped out this peece of publique pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer in all Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time which both in King <hi>He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> time and King <hi>Edwards</hi> time was uſed, that it could never be reſtored unto this day. Namely, <hi>From the tyranny of the Biſhop of Rome and all his deteſtable enormities, good Lord deliver us.</hi> For he knew full well no ſmall number of his owne enormious abominations were yet reteyned in the Diſcipline of the Church to the great comfort of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and of his ſonne Antichriſt the Pope, and his deare daughter the Church of Rome. And it might juſtly be taken for a Propheſie that we ſhould not in her dayes be delivered from the deteſtable enormities of the Biſhop of Rome, left unreformed in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time. But let us heare further what <hi>M. Bucer</hi> ſayth to King <hi>Edward</hi> in his ſecond booke of the kingdome of Chriſt and the 1 chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>Primum haud dubito, ſerenisſime Rex, Maieſtatem tuam ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam videre, hanc quam requirimus, imo quam requirit ſalus omnium noſtrum regni Chriſti reſtitutionem ab Epiſcopis nullo modo expectandam, &amp;c. Firſt I doubt not moſt gracious King</hi> (ſaith M. Bucer to King <hi>Edward) but your owne Maieſty doth ſee that this reſtoring agayne of the kingdom of Chriſt which we require, yea which the ſalvation of us all requireth, may in no wiſe be expected to com of the Biſhops; ſeeyng there be ſo few among them which do underſtand the power and proper offices of this kingdom: and very many of them by all meanes (which they posſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble can, and dare) either oppoſe themſelues againſt it, or deferre it
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:20397:43"/> and hinder it.</hi> And after in the ſame booke he concludeth ſaying. <hi>De reformando itaque Epiſcoporum ordine ſerenisſima Maieſtatis tuae cum primis animus intendendus. Therefore the mind of your moſt excellent Maieſtie muſt principally be ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reforming of the order of Biſhops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of theſe places before cited, firſt the reader may plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, with what vehemency this Angell and ſtarre hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the right hand of Chriſt deſireth and requyreth to haue the reformation in England, which yet cannot be obteyned, to be ſquared, according to the firſt Churches which were in the Apoſtles time. Secondly that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections which are now commonly made againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation are even the ſame, which Satan and his childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time; the wilfull &amp; horrible igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance wherof <hi>M. Bucer</hi> manifeſtly diſcovereth. Thirdly, that no hope of this reformation and the reſtoring of the kingdom of Chriſt, which even the ſalvation of us all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyreth, was to be expected at the hands of the Biſhops. Fourthly, that that the King ought ſpecially to bend his mind, to reforme the order or eſtate of the Biſhops. And to ſpeake the truth, ye might truely affirme that the King began at a wrong end, when he began at the pariſh Prieſts and leapt over the Lord Biſhops: for that was a tithing of mint and annis, and a leaving of the waightier matters of the law undone. It is a memorable and a true ſaying, that <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the Emperour uſed in the Counſell of <hi>Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sigiſmund.</note> 
               <hi>Non a minoritis ſed a maioritis incipiendum eſt.</hi> For where the Counſell prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to make a reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Church; one ſtood up and ſayd, the reformation muſt begin at the <hi>Fryer Minorits,</hi> that is at the litle ones: no ſayd the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, <hi>not at the litle ons, but at the great ones,</hi> meanyng that they ought to begin not at the beggerly <hi>Fryer Minors,</hi> but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:20397:44"/> at the pompous and proud Prelats and Popes. And <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> the Prophet ſpeaking of the beggerly ſort, and great men ſaith:<note place="margin">Ierem. 5.45</note> 
               <hi>Therefore I ſayd, ſurely they are poore, they are foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, for they know not the way of the Lord, nor the iudgment of their God. I will get me unto the great men, and will ſpeake vnto them: for they haue knowne the way of the Lord, and the iudgd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their God: but theſe haue altogether broken the yoke, and burſt the bonds.</hi> And in the 23 chapter: he ſayth ſpeaking of the Prophets which were the cheifeſt and in higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of all Eccleſiaſticall perſons in that time.<note place="margin">Chro. 23 15</note> 
               <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts concerning the Prophets, behold I will feed them with wormwood and make them drinke the water of gall, for from the Prophets of Ieruſalem is wickednes gon forth into all the land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us heare what <hi>M. Bucer</hi> ſaith touching the great livings of the Lord Biſhops, and the poore eſtat of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh Miniſters. Firſt to the Lord Biſhops he ſaith in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke of the kingdom of Chriſt, <hi>Agnoſcant igitur ta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem graviſsimam ſuam culpam Epiſcopi, quod eccleſias tam diu iam, tamque horrende, non tam neglexerunt quam vaſtaverunt.</hi> Let the Biſhops at the laſt acknowledg their moſt gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous fault, that now ſo long time they haue not onely neglected, but violently robbed the Churches. And in the 13 chapter he toucheth againe the reſtoring unto the poore Pariſhes that which the Biſhops by injurie and rob berie had taken from them. <hi>Si vero parochiis non ſit tam mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum reliquum, vt inde proſpici queat fidelibus earum miniſtris, tum certe, vti et ſupra diximus, ab Epiſcopis et ditioribus ſacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotiis petendum erit, unde et his deſpoliatis parochiis conſulatur. Hic communio ſanctorum exercenda erit, vt egentibus eccleſiis ſuccurratur ab iis quae abundant.</hi> If there be not (ſaith <hi>M. Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>) ſo much left unto the Pariſhes, as therof there may be
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:20397:44"/> made a ſufficient proviſion for their faithfull Miniſters, then certainly (as we haue ſayd before) there muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the Biſhops and richer benefices where with theſe pariſhes that haue been ſo ſpoyled, may be ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided for. For heerein the Communion of Saints ought to be exerciſed, that the Churches which ſtand in need may be helped by them, that doe abound. And a non after he ſayth? <hi>Valeat itaque Domini lex: dignus eſt opera rius cibo ſuo et mercede. Item duplici honore digni ſunt presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri qui bene praeſunt eccleſiis, maxime qui laborant in verbo et doctrina. Debent autem hi, et ſuo docere exemplo reliquos Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianos ut cum eis datur quibus alantar et tegantur, his ſint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenti. valeat et lex ſpiritus ſancti: veſtra abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tia ſublevet illo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum inopiam, et illorum abundantia ſublevet veſtram inopiam quo ſit inter vos aequalitas.</hi> Therfore let the law of the Lord take his force, which ſayth the worke man is worthy of his meate, and his wages, and alſo the Elders which rule the Churches well are worthy double honor, cheiflie thoſe which labour in the word and doctrine. And theſe alſo ought to teach all other Chriſtians by their example, and when there is given unto them, foode and rayment, with that let them be content. And alſo let the law of the holy Ghoſt ſtand in his full force: let your abundance vp hold their need, that there may be equalitie. I neede not to put the reader in any reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance what to obſerue in theſe wordes, they are playne enough; that the Lordly livings of Biſhops ſhould be taken from them, and they the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues ſhould not liue like Lords, but in a meane eſtate as well as the reſt of the Miniſters.<note place="margin">Bucer in ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thew 18.7.</note> And touching the reſt of the popiſh reliques he ſayth, <hi>vndoubtedly as there is no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement at all between Chriſt and Beliall; ſo ſinceare and unfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned chriſtians can by no meanes ſuffer themſelues to be clogged
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20397:45"/> with any whit of Antichriſts traſh and trumperie &amp;c. Wherfore ſo ſoone as true godlines and the right worſhip of God hath been preached and profeſſed of many, Antichriſts Ceremonies and rites ought by and by to be abrogated, and the reformation therof may not be prolonged &amp;c. Theſe are indeed (ſaith he) over mild and to ſoft and ſober Chriſtians which can beare with ſuch Antichri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtian traſh: like unto them who at Corinth knowing that an Idoll was nothing, did eat thinges offered unto Idols and boaſted (as theſe our men doe) in this wiſe: In outward matters we are free. What is that to me, that another uſeth thoſe thinges naughtily, I will uſe them well &amp;c. Thus do they for ſooth provide goodly for the weake ones, yea they ſerue their owne bellies, ſeeking to gratifie ſuch as are either Chriſts enimyes or elſe backſliders, for no man beſids theſe will earneſtly contend for Superſtitious Ceremonies: this is their modeſt bearing, and delaying, whereby they are ſo far from furthering of the Goſpell, that by litle and litle they do utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aboliſh it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus you heare <hi>M. Bucers</hi> judgment that noble light ſet up by God in <hi>Germanie,</hi> and by King <hi>Edward</hi> brought into <hi>England,</hi> and made the divinity Lecturer in <hi>Cambridg</hi> both for the eſtabliſhing of the Diſcipline ſet downe by Chriſt and his Apoſtles in the firſt Churches, for the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of the Lordly eſtate of Biſhops, and for the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aboliſhing of all our vayne and beggerly Ceremonies which he calleth <hi>Antichriſtian traſh.</hi> Unto him I will joyn <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> his combresbyter or fellow Elder,<note place="margin">P. Martyr.</note> brought into <hi>England</hi> alſo by King <hi>Edward,</hi> and made the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie Lecturer in <hi>Oxford.</hi> Whoſe departing from <hi>Argentine</hi> in <hi>Germanie,</hi> was greatly lamented, he was (ſaith <hi>Sleidan</hi>) a man there exceedingly beloved for his ſincere judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, his great mildnes and modeſtie, and for his incomporable learning. In his Epiſtle to the Lords of <hi>Polonia,</hi> profeſſors
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:20397:45"/> of the Goſpell, and Miniſters of the Church there, when they began to make the reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of religion in the rite of adminiſtring the Sacraments; ſaith <hi>M. Martyr, That man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner is moſt to be imbraced which ſhall be moſt playne, and moſt removed from the Papiſticall trifles and Ceremonies, and which ſhall come neereſt to the purenes which Chriſt uſed with his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Chriſtian minds ought not to be occupied much in outward rites &amp; Ceremonies, but to be fed by the word, to be inſtructed by the Sacraments, to be inflamed unto prayers, to be confirmed in good works, and excellent examples of life. Moreover I counſell you that in any wiſe ye bring in Diſcipline into your Churches ſo ſoone as posſible ye can, for if it be not receaved at the beginnyng when men are very deſirous of the Goſpell, it will not ſoone be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted afterward, when (as it hapneth) ſome coldnes ſhall creepe in. And how vainly you ſhall labour with out it very many Chur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ches may be an example unto you, who ſince they would not at their very firſt reformation take upon them this healthfull yoke, could never afterward, as touching manners and life, be brought into order by any iuſt rule, whereof it happeneth (which I ſpeake with greife) that all things in a manner haue ſmall aſſurance and and doe threaten ruine on every ſide. Therefore it is a greivous loſſ and a certayne deſtruction of Churches, to want the ſtrenght of Diſcipline. Neither can it be truely and ſoundly ſayd that they haue and do profeſſe the Goſpell, which either be without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cipline, or do contemne it, or be not delighted therwith. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſince in the Evangeliſts and in the Apoſtolike Epiſtles it is taught with ſo great diligence, it muſt be confeſſed not to be the leaſt part of Chriſtian religion. Whereby it commeth to paſſe that the Goſpell ſeemes to be deſpiſed of them which haue baniſhed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> themſelues ſo notable a portion thereof. But under what deviſe or couller it is reiected at this day in many places, is worth the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. They ſay that there is a danger, leaſt under the colour of
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:20397:46"/> Diſcipline, the Miniſters of the Church ſhould take upon them tyrannie, should correct, reproue, and excommunicate, for no iuſt cauſes, but at their owne pleaſure &amp;c. Neither do theſe good men perceiue, that there needeth not be any feare of the Miniſters, where the rule of the Goſpell as touching brotherly correction is obſerved. For this charge is not to be committed to the authority and will of one man: but in the shutting out from brotherly ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie them which will not be amended, a conſent of the Church muſt be had by whoſe authority if it be don, no man can iuſtly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne of the tyrannie of one, or of a few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Marke how this Divine lecturer, which hath ſo good teſtimonie, of his ſincere judgment, great modeſtie and mildnes, and of incomparable learnyng, would haue the Diſcipline receaved whereſoever any reformation of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is made, and ſaith plainly it is a great part of chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> religion, and a notable portion of the Goſpell, and that they which refuſe or reject it may be counted enimyes, and not lovers of the Goſpell. And that the charge of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication is not to be committed to one man or to a few, but to the whole Church. And as for the rites and Ceremonyes and adminiſtration of the Sacraments, he ſetteth downe theſe three caveats to be obſerved in the uſing of them. Firſt, that they be moſt plaine and ſimple. Secondly that they be moſt removed from the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious trifles of the Papiſts. Thirdly, that the manner of uſing them come neareſt, to the purenes that Chriſt and his Apoſtles uſed. Certainly if <hi>M. Martyr</hi> were now in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> and with all his ſinceritie, and modeſty, and learning, ſhould mayntaine this moſt playnenes in the Miniſtratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> moſt furdeſt removed from Popiſh Ceremonyes and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles, and cry out for the purenes that Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles uſed, he ſhould be turned out for a wrangler, or a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:20397:46"/> if he had no more hurt. But let us heere what <hi>M. Martyr</hi> ſaith further upon theſe poynts. In his Common places ſpeaking of the goverment of the Church he ſaith. <hi>If thou reſpect Chriſt it ſhall be called a Monarchie;</hi>
               <note place="margin">part 4 cha 5 ſect. 9 Com. in 1. Cor. <hi>5:</hi>13.</note> 
               <hi>For he is our King who with his owne bloud hath purchaſed the Church unto himſelfe. He is now gone into heaven, yet doth he governe this Kingdom of his; indeed not with viſible preſence, but by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and word of the holy ſcriptures. And there be in the Church which doe execute the office for him,</hi> Biſhops, Elders, Doctors <hi>and others bearing rule: in reſpect of whom it may be iuſtly called a goverment of many &amp;c. But becauſe in the Church there be matters of very great waight and importance referred unto the people (as it appeareth in the Acts of the Apoſtles) therfore it hath a conſideration of publicke goverment. But of the moſt waight are accounted excommunication, abſolution, chooſing of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and ſuch like: ſo as it is concluded, that no man can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated with out the conſent of the Church.</hi> And a non after he ſaith, Cyprian <hi>writteth unto</hi> Cornelius <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Rome, <hi>that he laboured much with the people that they which are fallen might haue pardon. Which if it might haue been given by himſelfe, there had been no need that he ſhould ſo greatly haue travelled in perſwading of the people. And</hi> Auguſtin <hi>againſt the Donatiſts ſheweth the ſame, when he ſaith: we muſt then ceaſe to excommunicate, if the whole people ſhall be infected with one and the ſelfe ſame vice. For it will not (ſayth he) conſent to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, but will defend and mainteine him whom thou shalt excommunicate. Wherefore this right perteineth to the Church neither ought to be taken from the ſame: againſt which opinion they cheifely are, which would haue the ſame to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to one Biſhop or Pope.</hi> And in the 5 ſection a litle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he giveth this definition of excommunication. <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicatio eſt &amp;c: Excommunication is the caſting out of a
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:20397:47"/> notorious wicked man from the fellowship of the faithfull, by the iudgment of them that be cheife, and the whole Church conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, by the authoritie of Chriſt and rule of the holy ſcriptures, to the ſalvation of him that is caſt out, and of the people of God.</hi> And after he had confirmed the ſame by divers places of ſcripture he ſayth. <hi>Seeing it is the Goſpell of Chriſt as touching all the parts, it ought to be receaved of the Church, and credit eve<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry wher to be given unto it. So as they are to be wondred at, which would profeſſe the Goſpell, and yet do exclude this particle.</hi> And touching the magnificence of Biſhops and their ſtately uſing of Civill affaires. In the ſame part and 20 chapter Section 16 he ſayth, <hi>But why in times paſt (in the old teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) were both Principalitie and Prieſthood ioyned together? This may be declared the cauſe; Namely that in thoſe perſons Chriſt was ſhadowed,</hi>

               <hi>to whom was due both the true Prieſthood &amp; Soveraigne Kingdom.

Since they haue ben ſo inſtructed by Chriſt. For he ſaide unto his Apoſtles.</hi> The Princes of the Nations haue dominion over them, but it ſhall not be ſo among you. <hi>And being requyred by a certaine man to command his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to devide the inheritance with him, ſaid,</hi> who made me a judge over you? <hi>Shewing that it agreeth not with his voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion while he remaineth upon the earth, to haue authoritie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide heritages.

Chriſt indeed did ſerue his vocation: for he came in humilitie, by his paſsion and death to redeeme mankind; but his example is not to be follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed in all things. Otherwiſe no chriſtian ovght to beare the office of a Magiſtrate: for Chriſt beare it not. Wherefore they affirme that he left an example onely to men tending to perfection: ſuch as are</hi> Monks <hi>and begging</hi> Friers <hi>which (as they ſay) haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the world. Neither can they a bide that Peter ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe unto his ſucceſſor when he ſaid,</hi> that he had neither gold nor ſilver, <hi>but that he left onely a patterne of perfection unto them, which ſo order their life as he did, who forſaking all that he had followed Chriſt, that he might the rediler ſerue him. But theſe men ſhould remember, that not onely examples, but alſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements make one our ſide. For Chriſt ſaith,</hi> The Kings of the Nations beare dominion over them, but ſo ſhall not yee. <hi>And theſe words are to be underſtanded ſingularly and particularly of the Apoſtles and Miniſters and not of all men univerſally &amp;c. Further who ſeeth not that theſe two functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons doe ſo hinder the one the other: that he which exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:20397:48"/> the one, cannot execute the other. For it is an hard matter to find one ſo prompt and readie that can rightly and orderly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter but even one of theſe functions.</hi> And agayne in his Common places the 4 part and 13. chapter ſection 12: he ſaith. <hi>But our falſe Eccleſiaſticks will be Princes and reigne, and yet Chriſt would be no King. And when he was ſought for to the end he ſhould be made a King he utterly refuſed it, yea rather he plainly confeſſed that his kingdom is not of this world: he ſayd alſo unto the Apoſtles,</hi> Princes of the Nations do beare rule over them, but ye ſhall not ſo doe. Peter <hi>alſo whoſe ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors theſe men profeſſe themſelues to be, warneth Miniſters that they ſhould not excerciſe dominion over the flocke.</hi> And upon the ſecond booke of Samuell the 6 chapter, he ſaith. <hi>Arca iſta per allegoriam non incommodam refert nobis eccleſiam Dei. This Arke by a fitte allegorie doth repreſent unto us the Church of God: which ought to be caried and borne at this day upon the ſhoulders of the Biſhops. But now many Biſhops do even the ſame thing that theſe Levites did, of whom we ſpake.

Bullingers <hi>are ſuch as whether they be uſed privatly or read publickly, whether of Miniſters of the word or other Gods children, certainly there wilbe found in them ſuch light and inſtruction for the ignorant, ſuch ſweetnes and ſpirituall comfort for conſciences, ſuch heavenly delights for ſoules; that as perfumes the more they are chafed the better they ſmell; &amp; as golden mines, the deeper ye digge them, the more richer they ſhew: ſo theſe the more dilligently ye peruſe them, the more delightfull they will pleaſe, and the deeper ye digge with dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtudie in their mynes, the more golden matter they will deliver forth to the glory of God.</hi> Now therefore let us heare what this Angell and light of the Goſpell ſet up by the Lord upon a golden candleſticke of <hi>Helvetia,</hi> ſaith.</p>

               <hi>Like as the Lord</hi> (ſaith M. Bullinger) <hi>would haue the tranſgresſing Miniſters privately to be admoniſhed &amp; corrected, ſo doth he extend the commoditie of the ſame admonition and correction to the whole Church. And therefore the Auncient Church had a holy Senat of Elders which dilligently warned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that tranſgreſſed in the Church, corrected them ſharply, yea, and excluded them out of the Eccleſiasſticall fellowſhip namely if they perccaved, that there was no hope of a mendment to be looked for in them. But in the latter times the Popes &amp; Biſhops tyrannically taking that kind of puniſhment into their hands, and excerciſing it ſacrilegiouſly contrary to the firſt inſtitution, haue turned an wholſome medicine into an hurtfull poyſon, making it abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble both to the good and bad.</hi> Behold what fruit this alteratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods order &amp; ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the Church hath brought, by taking away the Elderſhip from the Church or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and committing it unto the Biſhops: who by their Lordly authority tyrannically (ſaith <hi>M.

And ſhewing what the Elders were, he ſayth. <hi>Wherefore the Elders in the Church of Chriſt are either Biſhops or otherwiſe prudent &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men added to Biſhops that they may the more eaſily beare the burden layd upon them,</hi>

               <hi>And unleſſe that Chriſtians</hi> (ſaith Bullinger) <hi>when they are once made Kings ſhould conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in their office and governe kingdoms according to the rule and lawes of Chriſt, how (I beſeech you) ſhould Chriſt be called King of Kings &amp; Lord of Lords?

For even as he is appoynted of the Lord a Miniſter and an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not a Prince and a Pope: ſo alſo he appoynted no Princes in the Church, but Miniſters and Elders, who with the word of Chriſt should feed Chriſts flocke.</hi> And upon that place of Luke the 22: The Kings of the Gentiles raigne over the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; they that beare rule over the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are called gratious Lords &amp;c.<note place="margin">Decad 3: ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mon 3</note>

But before in the ſame ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon he ſayth. <hi>In the order of Bishops and Elders from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnyng there was ſingular humilitie, charitie, and concord, no contention or ſtrife for prerogatiue, or titles, or dignity. For all acknowledg themſelues to be the Miniſters of one Maſter, coequall in all thinges touching office or charge. He made them unequall not in office, but in gifts by the excellencie of gifts.</hi> And therfore in the firſt <hi>Decad</hi> &amp; ſecond ſermon, he ſaith, <hi>Did not Chriſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:20397:50"/> himſelfe refuſe a crowne upon earth? And did not he that is Lord of all, miniſter?

And it is to be obſerved, that</hi> S.

               <hi>that Biſhops ſhould be greater then other Miniſters, was ſuch a miſcheife to the Church, that we may thank the cuſtome thereof for all the wealth, pride; and tirannie of our Princely and riding Biſhops, and for the corruptions of all Churches; which if the au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cient Fathers did now ſee,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The Devils invention</note> 
               <hi>they would no doubt acknowledg it, not to be the device of the holy Ghoſt, as it was pretended; But of the Devill himſelfe to take away the true Miniſtery of the Church of God ſet downe by Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</hi> Now fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his booke of Common places, <hi>Tit.</hi> Of the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the word of God, he ſaith. <hi>It is not meete that a Biſhop do convert the power of his Miniſtery to other Churches, but to Miniſter faithfully in the ſame wherein he is elected and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, like as it was not convenient for the Apoſtle to convert his Apoſtleſhip to a Biſhopricke, and to be reſtrained to one Church onely:</hi>
               <note place="margin">As alſo it is unto Iames. The like is to be ſaid of Titus Tim. Mark Eva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <hi>which is falſly attributed unto the Apoſtle</hi> Peter. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let the Biſhops looke to themſelues, which wheras they doe not lawfully Miniſter in one Church, yet they do extend their power not to a few Churches, but unto whole Provinces alſo. Let them read</hi> Chryſoſtome <hi>upon the Epiſtle to</hi> Titus <hi>the firſt chapter,</hi> By Cities <hi>he ſayth.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:20397:52"/> but for Miniſters ſerving the will of the Lord.</hi> And a non after he ſayth. <hi>Thirdly, that Elders Bishops and Paſtors be all one, it is manifeſt by that which we doe read in this wiſe.</hi> And ſending meſſengers from Miletus to Epheſus,<note place="margin">Acts 20</note> he ſent for Prieſts or Elders of the Church, and when they came unto him, he ſayd, you know that from the firſt day &amp;c. And a litle after, Looke therfore to your ſelues and to all the flocke, in which the holy ſpirit hath ſet you Biſhops to feed the Church of God, &amp;c. <hi>The ſame which</hi> Luk <hi>calleth the Prieſts or Elders of the Church of</hi> Epheſus, <hi>thoſe</hi> Paul <hi>calleth Bishops, and ſayth, that they be ſet there to that intent, to feed the Church of God. So we do ſee manifeſtly, that Prieſts or Elders, Bishops &amp; Paſtors be all one. And that there was in one ſelfe ſame Church ioyntly together many Bishops, and that appoynted by the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rit, as we may ſee alſo by that which we do read in the Apoſtle, ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Paul and Timothie the ſervants of Ieſus Chriſt to all the Saints in Chriſt Ieſu, which be at Philippos together with the Biſhops and Deacons. <hi>Lo there were many Bishops togeather alſo at Philippos.</hi> And touching the queſtions in Baptiſme thus he intreateth thereof. Auguſtine <hi>ſaith, If we will in wordes declare that the litle children doe know in godly matters, which do not yet underſtand worldly matters, I feare leaſt we shall ſeeme to doe wrong unto our very ſenſes in ſo ſaying, whereas the playne evidence of the truth doth eaſily ſurmont all that ſtrength and meanes of our ſayings.

               <note place="margin">Aug. epiſ. <hi>57</hi> ad Dardan.</note> 
               <hi>where he writteth in this wiſe: It is anſwered, that the Child doth beleiue which hath not yet any affection of faith. It is anſwered that it hath faith becauſe of the Sacrament of faith. Thus (ſaith he) he calleth baptiſme the Sacrament of faith, But in caſe that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of faith, be faith, how is it ſaid that the infant hath faith which hath not yet baptiſme, and is therefore demanded whether
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:20397:53"/> that he doth beleiue, to the intent that he may receaue baptiſme? Agayne, the queſtion is not whether he hath the ſacrament of faith or not, but whether he doth beleiue? The queſtion is of faith and not of the Sacrament of faith; yet for all that it cannot be tru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly reported, that he hath faith therefore. And ſo it is a very feeble anſwer, that this great man maketh in this matter; for aſmuch as the infant when he is thus demanded hath neither faith, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſacrament of faith. For how should he haue that which he hath not receaved? But yet thus they are compelled to anſwer the matter, which will needs maintayne and keepe this cuſtome u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Church, without any ground of it. And this beyng ſo fond a cuſtome, that it cannot be defended, riſen firſt of this, that the Biſhops, did diſorderly apply that forme of baptiſing of ſuch as were of perfect yeares of underſtanding, unto the baptiſing alſo of infans, and ſo began to demand of infants of the abrenoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Satan, and of the faith in the holy Trinitie, as well as they did of them that were of yeares of full age. In my iudgment it were more convenient if the Father of the infant that is to be baptiſed were preſent at the font to require baptiſme for his child, and that he should be openly examined of his faith, by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in the preſence of them that ſtand by, of the faith, not which the infant hath, but which he himſelfe hath in Chriſt our Lord and Saviour; and whereunto he will bring up and teach his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant.</hi>

            <p>Unto <hi>M. Muſculus</hi> ſucceeded <hi>M.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:20397:53"/> that were left, or threatned greater plagues for lack of full reformation. Whereupon <hi>M. Gualter</hi> in his firſt ſermon upon the Prophet <hi>Zephaniah</hi> uſeth this ſpech in the name of the Lord. <hi>My ſervant Ioſiah removed away many thinges. But becauſe through your ungodlines many thinges yet remaine being contrary to my lawes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gualt. upon Zepha, ſer. 1</note>

The firſt is, when the remnant of ſuperſtitions is kept, when God granteth libertie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme things, craftie diſſemblers do attend uprn theſe ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereunto they beare good will and by litle and litle ſpread them a broad, by and by after followeth open Idolatry: but leaſt they ſhould ſeeme to forſake God altrgother, firſt theris invented a certaine mixture, but the ſame at the length degenerateth to a playne defection or falling from God: and theſe things certainely, even at this day are ſeene every where:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Behold Eng<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>land.</note> 
               <hi>and do we as yet marveil at the wrath of God, hanging over our heads. Let us learne there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to attend and waigte upon the word of God, to flie all occaſion of evill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O that our Prelats of England, would attend &amp; wait upon the word of God and ſo flie all occaſion of evill: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſidering the degrees of ſuperſtition how they increaſed even in King <hi>Ioſiahs</hi> time, namly, by retayning the relicks of ſuperſtition, and not to invent a certaine mixture, wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>by muſt needs follow a degeneration, to a playne defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and falling from God. For every country man can tell that if a crab tree be graft with the ſweet apple called the apple of paradice, or with the moſt excellent apple that is in the world, although the graft doe grow and flouriſh
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:20397:54"/> marvelouſly well: yet if the ſients be ſuffered to grow, by litle and litle within a while, the crabb tree ſients will ſo prevaile, and the graft of the good fruit ſo decay, that the whole tree will turne againe to be a crabb tree and beare no fruit but crabbes. So in King <hi>Henrie 8</hi> time the Popes ſupreame head was cut of, and the graft of Gods word was ſet up in every Church through out England: <hi>which graft</hi> (as <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith) <hi>is able to ſaue our ſoules</hi> if it be receaved with all meeknes and all filthines layd a part.<note place="margin">Iames. 1.</note> But King <hi>Henrie</hi> 8 ſuffered almoſt all the boughes upon the ſtocke beneath the graft to grow. King <hi>Edward</hi> pared of many of them: Queene <hi>Mary</hi> layd ſuch violent handes upon the graft, that ſhe pulled it clean out of the ſtock &amp; caſt it into the fire. Our late gratious <hi>Queene Elizabeth</hi> receaved fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heaven a graft agayne, and ſet it into the ſtock: which by the blesſing of God grew &amp; flouriſhed, but the boughes and ſients which King <hi>Edward</hi> left ſhee ſuffered ſtill to grow. As the pompous eſtate of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> with the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of <hi>pluralities</hi> and <hi>Nonreſidencies;</hi> and ſuch like, with divers bad and beggerly <hi>Ceremonies</hi> which all remaine to this day. O that our Prelats of <hi>England</hi> would lift up their eyes to heaven and behold the wrath of God which (as <hi>Gualter</hi> ſaith) hangeth over our heads for theſe reliques of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and other our ſinfull wickednes: then would they ſurely, be ſo farr from mainteinyng the ſame or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading his Majeſtie to let them continue, that humblie one their knees they would beſeech him (though all their wealth and pompe ſhould periſh) yet with his mightie hand to rent of the crabb tree ſcients, and with the ſharp ſword, to cut of the boughes that grow upon the ſtocke, whereby the bleſſed graft of Gods word might liuely grow and flouriſh: which exceept it be donne can never
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:20397:54"/> proſper, nor as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh can never haue free paſtage &amp; be glorified. And it is worthy to be noted that to his great honor it is written. <hi>Ioſiah alſo tooke away them that had familiar ſpirits, and the Soothſayers, and the Images,</hi>

For where very great defection and falling away from true religion is eſtabliſhed by publicke authoritie, it is a merveilous difficult matter for a Prince that would make reformation therof, to eſpie whatſoever ought to be reformed. So that if there be not daylie more and more amended, the ſients of the crabb tree ſtock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuffered will out grow the graft and ſpoyle the tree: as we ſee in this moſt excellent reformation which <hi>Ioſiah</hi> made, which yet is ſo bitterly taxed, not only by <hi>Zephani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> the Prophet but alſo by <hi>Ieremia</hi> as you may read in the third chapter, where he ſayth, <hi>The Lord ſayd alſo unto me,</hi>

At laſt he concludeth, <hi>Theſe I ſay and many ſuch like things they heard of Chriſt, yet forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them all, they dreamed of a worldly kingdome in which they hoped likewiſe they ſhould be Lords.</hi> This dreame of theirs a-man would haue thought, that Chriſt had beaten out of their braynes long before,<note place="margin">Luc. 22.25.26.</note> when he ſayd unto them. <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles reigne over them, and they that beare rule ovcr them are called gratious Lords, but ye ſhall not be ſo: but let the greateſt among you be as the leaſt, and the cheifeſt as he that ſerveth.</hi> Notwithſtanding this dreame of being Lords un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a worldly King, did ſo pleaſantly ſwym and had ſo ſweet a ſmell within their earthly braynes, that nothing but the miraculous gift of the holy Ghoſt could picke it out. From which ſweete dreame, our ſleeping <hi>Sardian An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells</hi> and Lordbiſhops even at this day will not be a waked but with a warme, &amp; gay coulered cloake they cover the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues ſaying, it was not Superioritie and Lordſhip that Chriſt forbad his Apoſtles, but pride, ambition, and tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall rule. Or elſe, that they beyng Church Miniſters ſhould take no rule over their brethren, unleſſe they had it by ſpeciall commisſion from ſome Magiſtrat. But who (except he be a <hi>Sardian Angell,</hi> that will not be awaked) ſeeth not, that Chriſt forbad them that degree, and ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie, which they deſired to haue under him, ſimplie? Which ſurely was none other, but to haue under him an honeſt rule, and Lordſhip, yea I ſay by Commisſion from him; of whom they then imagined that he ſhould be (as a Teacher, ſo) a juſt and Supreame civill Magiſtrat likewiſe. For none but a blaſphemer of Chriſt &amp; of his holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,

For then muſt it needes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that they ſuppoſed that both they and he himſelfe ſhould raigne like cruell, proud, and ambitious tyrants. which God forbid that any chriſtian ſhould dreame, that ever it came within their thoughts. Therefore it is moſt cleere and evident, that Chriſt forbad his Apoſtles and in them all Paſtors and Eccleſiaſticall perſons, all Lordſhip and Magnificent eſtate, with whatſoever modeſtie &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie they would cary themſelues therein, yea though they might by any Commisſion haue it. <hi>M.

The other is, that the calling be lawfull, that is, ſuch a calling, as is ſquared accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the preſcript lawes of the doctrine and Diſcipline of the Apoſtles. The third is the preſcript adminiſtration of the holie callings. Now all theſe we advouch to haue been by litle and litle utterly overthrowne by the Papiſticall tyrannie, which with the Apoſtles we may iuſtly call the myſterie of iniquitie. 3 And firſt we affirme that the callings of the Popiſh Cleargy, which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe by that proud title of Hierarchie, are in part altogether falſe; that is, ſuch as haue at the firſt been invented by man and afterwards became meerelie diueliſh; and in part counterfeite, that is ſuch as onely retained the names of true callings which they aboliſhed indeed.</hi> 4 <hi>Theſe functions following, we hold to be altogether falſe and deſtitute of all true foundation, namely, the Primacie of the Bishop of Rome over all Churches, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalſhip, Patriarkſhip, Archiepiſcopalſhip, &amp; breifly that whole Epiſcopall degree of Lord Biſhops over their fellow Elders.</hi>

For as every one among the Nobles is beloued of Kings, ſo he climeth up to wealth and offices. But Chriſt ſet Paſtors over his Church, not to beare a Lorlie rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, but to Miniſter. So the error of the Anabaptiſts which doe baniſh Kings &amp; Magiſtrats from the Church of God, becauſe Chriſt ſayd they were not like his Diſciples, is overthrowne: For the compariſon is not made heere between Chriſtians and propha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e men, but between offices</hi> And anon after he ſaith, <hi>So David, Ezekias, and ſuch like when aswillingly they became the ſerva<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet were they adorned with the Scepter, Diadem, Thro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e and other ſuch enſignes. But the goverment of the Church admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:20397:60"/> no ſuch thing. For Chriſt gaue no more allowance to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors then that they ſhould be Miniſters, and that they ſhould alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether abſtaine from Lordlie government.</hi> I need not to make any explanation of his words, for they are plaine enough; further for the election of Biſhops &amp; Miniſters, <hi>M.

And thus, both ploughes not walking, nothing ſhould be in the common weale but hunger. For ever ſince the Prelats were made Lords and Nobles, the plough ſtandeth, there is no worke done, the People ſtarue. They hauke, they hunt, they card, they dice, they paſtime in their Pallacies with gallant gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, with their dancing Minions, and with their freſh compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, ſo that ploughing is ſet aſide.

And wherefore are Magiſtrats ordayned, but that the tranquillitie of the common weale may be confirmed, limitting both ploughes.

They are otherwiſe occupied ſome in Kings matters, ſome are Ambaſſadors, ſome of the privie Counſell, ſom to furniſh the Court, ſom are Lords of the Parliament, ſome are Preſidents, and controwlers of mints.

               <hi> And in ſaying of theſe wordes, they put upon the ſaid</hi> D. Ridley <hi>the Surplice, with all the trin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets appertayning to the Maſſe; and as they were putting on the ſame;</hi> D. Ridley <hi>did vehemently inveigh againſt the Romiſh Biſhop, &amp; all that fooliſh apparell, calling him Antichriſt &amp; that apparell fooliſh and abominable, yea to fond for a vice in a playe.</hi> Wherin theſe fiue things are to be obſerved in this peece of dialogue. Firſt, that none of all the Popiſh attire is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, but the <hi>Surples,</hi> and that is named three times, that it might not be forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Secondly, that <hi>M. Ridley</hi> compares thoſe Popiſh garments to the attire that in ſcorne and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite <hi>Herod</hi> and the reſt of the crucifiers put upon Chriſt. Which thing as you heard before, <hi>M. Iohn Huſſe</hi> ſpeaketh of ſaying; <hi>That when they put the white garment upon him, he could not but remember how Herod put the white garment upon Chriſt to ſcorne him with all.</hi> Thirdly, that he compareth the very crueltie thereof, with the cruell and ſhamefull dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt Chriſt. As likwiſe our booke of Martyrs ſaith of <hi>M. Hooper,</hi> when he was driven by Ridley and the reſt,<note place="margin">Acts &amp; Mo. pag. 667. edit. 1570</note> to weare the popiſh apparell. Thus ſaith our book of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs. <hi>He had upon his head a geometricall, that is a foure ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red cap, able it that his head was round. What cauſe of ſhame</hi> (ſaith Maſter Fox) <hi>the ſtrangnes thereof was that day to that good preacher, every man may eaſily iudge.</hi> Fourthly, that the ſame rod of Gods correction was now layd upon <hi>M. Ridley,</hi> which he and the reſt of the Biſhops had laid upon
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:20397:72"/> their fellow Elder <hi>M. Hooper.</hi> Fiftly, how vehement the ſpirit of God ſtirred him up to deteſt the <hi>ſurplice</hi> and the reſt of the Popiſh apparell, calling the Pope Antichriſt, &amp; the <hi>ſurplice</hi> with the reſt of the Popiſh apparell, <hi>fooliſh</hi> and <hi>abominable,</hi> and <hi>to fond for a vice in a playe.</hi> Alas that ever the good &amp; learned preachers of the word of God ſhould be compelled either to looſe their Miniſtery, or elſe to be attyred like vices and fooles in playes. But let us go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and heare what this noble witnes and Martyr of God ſaith in other poyntes of reformation now deſired. In his treatiſe, wherein is conteyned a lamentation for the change of religion in <hi>England,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts &amp; Mo. pag 1946. edit. 1570</note> he ſaith. <hi>There are in the Papiſtrie, an innumerable rablement of abominations.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which he ſetteth downe by name, <hi>diſpenſations, and immunities from all godly Diſcipline, lawes, and good order, plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralityes, and totquots,</hi> (and as he ſaith) <hi>a thowſand moe.</hi> O, that diſpenſations of Nonreſidencies, pluralities, vnions, and totquots, which <hi>M. Ridley</hi> nombreth among the rableme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Popiſh abominations, were out of <hi>England,</hi> and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto the Pope which he ſo often calleth Antichriſt, and to his ſpouſe the Church of Rome which he calleth the very whore of Babilon. And for the name of <hi>Prieſt</hi> in his diſputation at <hi>Oxford,</hi> he ſaith. <hi>There are but two onely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Preiſthood allowed in the word of God, namely the order of</hi> Aaron <hi>and the order of</hi> Melchiſedech, <hi>but now the order of</hi> Aaron <hi>is come to an end, by reaſon it was unprofitable and weake</hi> Hebr. 7. <hi>And of the order of</hi> Melchiſedech, <hi>there is but one Prieſt alone, even Chriſt.</hi> And generally of all matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, ſpeaking of the Church of Rome, before ſhe plaied the harlot,<note place="margin">Acts &amp; Mo: pag 1939. edit. 1570.</note> and maried her ſelfe to Antichriſt, he ſaith. <hi>If ye will know how long that was and how many hundred of yeares: to be curious in poynting the preciſe number of yeares, I will not
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:20397:72"/> be to bold. But thus I ſay ſo long and ſo many hundred yeares, as that ſea did truely teach and Preach that Goſpell, that religion, exerciſed that power, and ordered every thing by theſe lawes and rules, which that ſea receaved of the</hi> Apoſtles (<hi>&amp; as</hi> Tertullian <hi>ſaith) the Apoſtles of Chriſt, and Chriſt of God: So long I ſay, that ſea might haue been called Peter and Paules chaire and ſea, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſts chaire, and the Biſhop therof</hi> Apoſtolicus, <hi>or a true diſciple and ſucceſſor of the Apoſtles.</hi> How happie were we &amp; all our Biſhops, if by this rule of M. Ridley, they might be called <hi>Apoſtolici,</hi> and <hi>true Diſciples</hi> and <hi>Succeſſors of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles:</hi> which cannot be till every thing be ordered by theſe lawes and rules, which they receaue from the Apoſtles, &amp; the Apoſtles of Chriſt, and Chriſt of God.<note place="margin">Cranmer.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now although I haue alreadie ſpoken of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> yet heere agayne I cannot but compare him to <hi>Solomon</hi> with his many hundred wiues, who at the laſt drew him to Ido<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>latry and all abominations. So <hi>Cranmer</hi> being married to many hundred Churches, was at the laſt driven to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to all abominations of Popery. For well may we compare the many hundred wives and concubines of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> unto the multitude of Churches ſubject unto an Archbiſhop.<note place="margin">pag 929. ed. 1570.</note> And rightly no doubt it is ſpoken by one of the bleſſed Martyrs in our booke of Actes &amp; Monume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, that it is as lawfull for a lay man to haue two wiues at once: as for a preiq to haue two benefices. And <hi>Cranmer</hi> being the elect child of God, with <hi>Solomon</hi> at the laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted the foulnes of his owne fall. Firſt he fired his owne hand for ſubſcribing to all the abominatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of Antichriſt; and ſo entred through the fire of torments, into euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting ioye with Chriſt.<note place="margin">Iewell.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The like may be ſayd of <hi>Iewel</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Salisburie,</hi> who although he did beare much with the injquitie of the <gap reason="missing" extent="2 pages">

Iuell</hi> rejecteth it, as though therby they counted Chriſt and his Apoſtles as children and babes: without wit and judgment to know what was fit for the Church of God and to be uſed in all ages. And yet ſaith he, when they liſt they ſhall be counted holy Fathers &amp; holy Doctors. And againſt our <hi>double</hi> fleeced men thus he ſpeaketh; <hi>O that Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gcus the Prophet were now a liue and ſaw the rearing up of Gods Temple here in England,</hi>

               <hi>Theſe Nonreſidents and pluralitie men teach not, they know not, nor care for the people of their charg, they haue brought confuſion and ſhame into the houſe of God.</hi> If it be true which this excellent <hi>Iewel</hi> of England ſaith, that Nonreſidents &amp; plurality men are they that bring ſhame and confuſion in to the houſe of God: with what face can any Chriſtian man maintayne them &amp; not rather inveigh againſt them?

            <p> Wherein every Reader may obſerue theſe things.

And not like an Apoſtle or Evange<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liſt; to travell from flocke to flocke, &amp; from place to place. Secondly by the ſcripture there is no difference between a Biſhop and a Miniſter: which is ſo cleere and manifeſt, that the very Papiſt himſelfe is driven to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſe it. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it being true which the moſt rankeſt Papiſt for ſhame cannot denie, that by the ſcripture Biſhops &amp; Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters differ not. Then the glorious ſucceſſion of the Pope, and all his Dioceſan, and Lordbiſhops, are utterly overthrowne. For as <hi>M. Bradford</hi> ſaith. What Lordly eſtate can any Biſhop get, when he ought not to differ from the poore and meane eſtate of a Miniſter? Fourthly, that they are Papiſts which will haue a Miniſter of the Goſpell to be called a Prieſt: for tell me ſaith <hi>Bradford</hi> whether the ſcripture know any difference between a Biſhop and a Miniſter <hi>which you call a Prieſt.</hi>

Then ſpake they that feared the Lord</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>every one to his neighbour, and the Lord hearkened, and heard it, and a booke of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the Lord, and that thought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his name: And they ſhalbe to me ſaith the Lord of hoſtes, in that day that I ſhall doe this, for a flocke; and I will ſpare them as a man ſpareth his owne ſonne that ſerveth him.</hi> This is ever the condition of thoſe that forſake God, they repent of any good beginning if they ſee no worldly profit, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther troubles to come thereof. And ſpeciallie if they ſee wicked men preferred &amp; com to promotion, they repine of the continuance in the ſerving of God, ſeeing there is neither profit nor promotion that way to be gotten. But every one that feareth God (ſaith the prophet) though he be never ſo privat a perſon, yet ſpeaketh even the truth boldlie to his neighbour. And the Lord hearkeheth and heareth him, and their wordes are written up in a booke (Gods remembrance) and they ſhall enjoye the ſweete heavenly promiſſe, for although they be but weake and ſinfull men; yet will the Lord ſpare them as a Father ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his ſonne that ſerveth him.
